Many DIYre have made PCB rulers. In order to have a lot of information, usually PCB rulers are very large

I want it to be easy to carry, so I plan to limit the PCB ruler to less than 10cm, so I can use it as a key chain

I called my good friends at JLCPCB and asked if they would be interested in sponsoring this project, and they agreed. In other words, this project is brought to you by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/HAR), which makes high-quality prototype PCBs for people all over the world. They have more than 300,000 global customers and more than 8,000 orders every day! They have more than 10 years of manufacturing experience and are very reliable. Try it yourself, you can get 10 PCBs for only $2 at JLCPCB, thank you [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/HAR).

To design it, I used the free software [JLCPCB](https://EasyEDA.com), which is free to use, just run in the browser, and if needed, there is an offline desktop application.

I first start with the circuit board outline, which is easy to accomplish using the circuit board outline tracking tool. The ruler measures 10 cm x 1.5 cm. I added some resistor/capacitor packages through the EasyEda library.

After all, I added my logo, and the JLC PCB logo and design are complete.

Just a quick example how to order PCB from JLCPCB.com:

1)press "QUOTE NOW"

2)press "Add your gerber files"

3)upload zip or rar

4)all properties could be left default

*the only thing You should change from properties is PCB Color

After about few Days i received my PCBs.

As per normal JLCPCB delivered some super high quality and amazing PCBs.

I hope you all enjoyed this fun little project and i hope to see some of you make your own version of this ruler.
